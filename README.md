## 🔥 Key Features

**Calm Hub** is designed to deliver a complete and fluid control experience with a primary focus on performance and security:

### 🔫 1. Advanced Recoil Control
A smart system for weapon recoil compensation with precise customization options:
* **Game & Weapon Library:** Create unlimited "profiles" for specific games (e.g., CS2, Valorant) and customize settings for each individual weapon.
* **Precision Control (X/Y Axis):** Sliders to fine-tune vertical and horizontal recoil compensation.
* **Humanization System:** Adds smart randomization to mouse movements to make the control appear natural and "Legit."
* **Activation Modes:** Works via Left Click only or by combining Right Click + Left Click (Scope Mode).

### 🖱️ 2. Smart Auto Clicker
* **Adjustable Speed (CPS):** Full control over Clicks Per Second.
* **Trigger Modes:** Supports "Toggle" (On/Off) or "Hold" (Press and hold) modes.
* **Key Binding:** Easily bind the feature to any mouse button or keyboard key.

### 🏃 3. Movement Assistant
* **Auto Strafe:** Automatic left/right movement (A/D) while firing to make you harder to hit.
* **Bunny Hop (Bhop):** Automatic continuous jumping when holding the Spacebar.

### 👁️ 4. Visuals & UI
* **External Crosshair:** Draws a custom overlay crosshair over any game (Control shape, color, size).
* **Modern GUI:** Built using `CustomTkinter` with full Dark Mode support.
* **Status Overlay:** Transparent window displaying the current weapon, game, and activation status.

### 🔒 5. Security & System
* **Login System:** Protects the application with private passcodes.
* **Auto-Save System:** All settings are automatically saved (JSON) and restored upon launch.
* **Edit Lock:** Prevents accidental setting changes during gameplay.
